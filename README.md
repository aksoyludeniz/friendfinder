# friendfinder
application to find people with common interests

1 - create  two html pages for home and survey

2 - add the array list for the common interests and module export that variable associated with the array

3 - create two routing files one for the html site and the apiroute
require a path package for the html route.

3a - the html site will use the app.get paths to connect both html files.

3b - in the api route files create empty keys to store data and run a for loop from the survey.js file. create a variable for the path we are using for the file and create
empty keys that will be used as placeholders for new data. loop the new data from the
responses for the questions while comparing to the array and parse the data and push it to the array. I was unsuccessful in this.


4 - start the server.js file and add body-parser ,express.


5 - initiate npm init-y on the directory

6 - install all three packages

7 - link up bestMatch and survey data from the html homepage as variables that
will be stored in the apiRoutes

 create empty keys to store data and run a for loop for the existing array in api routes.htmlRoutes
